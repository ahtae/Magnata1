          This application was inspired by the rejection therapy game created by
          Jason Comely and popularized by Jia Jiang in his TED Talk called "What
          I learned from 100 days of rejection." The rules of the game are
          simple. There is only one real rule; you be rejected by another person
          at least once, everyday. However, for it to count as a rejection, you
          have to be out of your comfort zone, for your request to be denied,
          and for you to be in the position of vulnerability.
